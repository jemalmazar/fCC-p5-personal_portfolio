View deployed web page at: https://jemalmazar.github.io/fCC-p5-personal_portfolio/

### Project Description

A very basic portfolio page inspired by an old personal landing [page](https://jemalmazar.github.io/) which was customized from Dinesh Pandiyan's [Dev Landing Page](https://github.com/flexdinesh/dev-landing-page) project.

### Tools & Methods Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- CSS Grid
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) (browser-sync, gulp-clean-css, gulp-rename)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

### Little Things I Learned

- how to use `position: sticky` and `top: 0` to quickly make a navbar stick to the top of the viewport on scroll

### Project Epilogue

Chose a simple design and implementation to finish this project quickly. I knew that if I started looking at other dev portfolio's for inspiration I would end up spending far too much time overdesigning a simple project.

I'll save the fancy personal portfolio for when I've learned the fancier technologies.üòÅ
